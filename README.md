ü™ê Asteroids ‚Äì Classic Arcade Remake in C++
This is a modern recreation of the classic Asteroids arcade game, made using C++ and the olcPixelGameEngine. The game captures the fast-paced, minimalist charm of the original ‚Äî with a few modern touches.

üéÆ How the Game Works
You control a small spaceship drifting through space. Asteroids appear from all directions, and your job is to dodge or destroy them.

Use the arrow keys to rotate and thrust your ship.

Press space to fire bullets.

When you shoot a large asteroid, it breaks into smaller pieces.

If you get hit by an asteroid, you lose a life.

Clear all asteroids to move to the next level.

Survive through 5 levels to win the game.

The game includes:

A start menu with a fade-in "Press Start" effect.

A simple HUD showing your current score, level, and remaining lives.

A Game Over screen and a You Win screen, both with restart options.

‚ú® Features
Smooth screen-wrapping movement

Dynamic asteroid shapes generated with randomness

Classic arcade controls and feel

Fade-in menu animation using sine-based transparency

Simple state machine: Menu ‚Üí Playing ‚Üí Game Over / Win

üí° Why I Made This
I wanted to recreate one of the most iconic 2D games as a way to practice working with:

Game loops

Collision detection

State transitions

Basic visual effects

Everything is built from scratch using raw C++ and the olcPixelGameEngine ‚Äî no engines or frameworks beyond that.
